# ttta: Tools for temporal text analysis

## Desired Input Format
- If possible: Online models. So models that can get the time chunks as inputs one by one
- List of files, where each file represents a seperate time chunk
- A single time chunk as a list of lists of str to update the model

## Todo:
- inculde PoiRR, RollingLDA, topicalchanges, static diachronic embeddings, contextualized diachronic embeddings
- add preprocessing
- create common input structures for all models
- create pipeline for any model
